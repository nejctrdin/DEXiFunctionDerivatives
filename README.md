# DEXiFunctionDerivatives
This is an application which enables the users to input a DEXi type function, and produces the values of first partial derivatives in the function's defined points.

The functions is defined in three lines: the first line gives the integer output for the corresponding sorted input values. The inputs are sorted firstly by the first attribute, then second, etc. The second line of the function gives the names of the input attributes, delimited by a comma. The last line gives the sizes of the respective input's scales, which are also integral.

For exact syntax check the examples above.
